# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to begin to learn how to code. I built this project to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--skills that are essential to being a web developer. I will build on these skills during the coding boot camp, and I look forward to learning more about these languages in the boot camp. I also built this project to become familiar with GitHub and the process of version control.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
