          <li>The head element contains metadata. Data info about data that the user does not see.</li>
          <li>The body element contains visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Tags refer to what appears inside angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Element refers to entire element from opening to closing tage.</li>
          <li>The parent element is the element that holds all of the children.</li>
          <li>The child elements refers to elements nested inside other elements.</li>
          <li>Best practice is to use semantic HTML elements whenever possible. The body element is an example of semantic HTML element.</li>
          <li>src, alt, id and class are examples of attributes.</li>
          <li>When using headings order matters, and the biggest heading should only appear once on each page.</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>An external CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage.</li>
            <li>An external sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. This is also referred to as separation of concerns.</li>
            <li>The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules/declarations will apply.</li>
            <li>Then you declare your property and values for the element.</li>
            <li>Property that we want to apply, like color, and value of that property, like red.</li>
            <li>Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. It isn't visible to the user and acts as a buffer. When it is set to 0 we are saying we want no extra space around the element.</li>
            <li>Padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are making the entire element bigger. It is transparent.</li>
            <li>The CSS Box Model thinks of every html element as a box.</li>
            <li>The asterick * is used to apply a rule to all elements visible on a page.</li>
            <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together using a comma. This helps coders write DRY code.</li>
            <li>Use the link element to link html with the css sheet.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning a rule to a class attribute with a class selector. The class attribute can be assigned to the element in html.</li>
            <li>A design guide/system or brand book contains detailed guidelines that detail the colors, fonts, spacing between items on a page, appropriate writing style, etc. for a project.</li>
