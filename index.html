          <li>The head element contains metadata. Data info about data that the user does not see.</li>
          <li>The body element contains visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Tags refer to what appears inside angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Element refers to entire element from opening to closing tage.</li>
          <li>The parent element is the element that holds all of the children.</li>
          <li>The child elements refers to elements nested inside other elements.</li>
          <li>Best practice is to use semantic HTML elements whenever possible. The body element is an example of semantic HTML element.</li>
          <li>src, alt, id and class are examples of attributes.</li>
          <li>When using headings order matters, and the biggest heading should only appear once on each page.</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>An external CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage.</li>
            <li>An external sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. This is also referred to as separation of concerns.</li>
            <li>The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules/declarations will apply.</li>
            <li>Then you declare your property and values for the element.</li>
            <li>Property that we want to apply, like color, and value of that property, like red.</li>
            <li>Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. It isn't visible to the user and acts as a buffer. When it is set to 0 we are saying we want no extra space around the element.</li>
            <li>Padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are making the entire element bigger. It is transparent.</li>
            <li>The CSS Box Model thinks of every html element as a box.</li>
            <li>The asterick * is used to apply a rule to all elements visible on a page.</li>
            <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together using a comma. This helps coders write DRY code.</li>
            <li>Use the link element to link html with the css sheet.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning a rule to a class attribute with a class selector. The class attribute can be assigned to the element in html.</li>
            <li>A design guide/system or brand book contains detailed guidelines that detail the colors, fonts, spacing between items on a page, appropriate writing style, etc. for a project.</li>

            <li>git status: checks what branch I am currently working on.</li>
            <li>git checkout main: takes me back to the main branch.</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
            <li>git add: tracks changes made in branch.</li>
            <li>git commit -m "command": to commit files. Write git commit commands as imperative commands in the present tense.</li>
            <li>git pull origin main: to double check if local branch is in sync with base branch. Look for message: Already up to date.</li>
            <li>git push origin branch-name: use to push changes from local computer to github.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>A string follows the variable.</li>
            <li>All strings must be surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
            <li>To access the strong simply refer to the variable's name.</li>
            <li>Console.log() is a method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument, i.e., a variable.</li>
            <li>The .log() portion is a method, a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. It will output whatever is inside the parenthesis.</li>
            <li> JS files are linked at the bottom of the body element.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JS code runs from first statement at the top of the page to last statement at the bottom, ie, linear.</li>
            <li>Using conditional logic you can control the flow of an application, and the order of code affects the outcome.</li>
            <li>Use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which the code is executed.</li>
            <li>Conditional statements are 'if' statements. The code executes if the statement meets the condition, or is true.</li>
            <li>A statement is considered truthy if it means the conditions, or is a value of 'true.'</li>
            <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", Undefined, NaN, or Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
            <li>We can have more than one condition by using 'else if.'</li>
            <li>A strict equality operator === checks to see if two values are equal.</li>
            <li>Use an array if you need to perform a task on 50 or more variables at once. </li>
            <li>Arrays are not limited to single types of data--they can hold strings, numbers, etc.</li>
            <li>For an array, the data is wrapped in brackets.</li>
            <li>To work with individual items in an array, we use indexes. Indexes give each piece of data a location.</li>
            <li>Arrays are 0-indexed.</li>
            <li>Use for loops if we have an array that contains 100s or more items.</li>
            <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a task.</li>
            <li>Functions are not automatically executed. You must call it by name in order to execute it.</li>
            <li>When we declare a function in the JS code, we are creating a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.</li>
